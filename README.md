# copy-markdown-file-preserving-dates

I created this script so that creation and modification dates would be preserved when I was copying markdown files from one Obsidian Vault (a folder of markdown notes) to another vault.

This python script will copy markdown files from folder A to folder B.

You can modify each markdown file by adding your own modification code as indicated in the comments of the script.

The updated file will be placed in folder B with the SAME creation and modification dates as the original markdown file in Folder A.
